LND Express API Server
This is a simple but powerful backend server built with Node.js and Express that provides a RESTful API to communicate with your LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node.

How to Set Up and Run
1. Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) installed on your system.

LND Node: You must have a running LND node. This server is designed to connect to it.

LND Credentials: You need access to your LND node's tls.cert and admin.macaroon files, as well as its gRPC host address.

2. Installation
Clone the project: Create a directory for this project and save the index.js, package.json, and .env files inside it.

Install dependencies: Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

npm install

3. Configuration
Edit the .env file: This is the most important step. Open the .env file and replace the placeholder values with the correct details for your LND node.

LND_GRPC_HOST: The IP address or hostname and gRPC port of your LND node (e.g., localhost:10009 or 192.168.1.100:10009).

LND_MACAROON_PATH: The absolute file path to your admin.macaroon.

LND_TLS_CERT_PATH: The absolute file path to your tls.cert.

Security Note: The .env file contains sensitive credentials. It should never be committed to a public repository. The provided .gitignore file will prevent this.

4. Running the Server
For production:

npm start

For development (with automatic restarts on file changes):

npm run dev

If the connection to your LND node is successful, you will see a confirmation message in your console, along with a list of available API endpoints.

API Endpoints
Once the server is running, you can interact with it using a tool like curl or Postman, or by building a frontend application that communicates with these endpoints.

GET /api/getinfo: Retrieves general information about your node.

GET /api/balance: Gets your node's on-chain and channel balances.

POST /api/invoice: Creates a new invoice.

Body: { "value": <sats>, "memo": "<description>" }

GET /api/invoices: Lists all invoices.

GET /api/payments: Lists all outgoing payments.

POST /api/pay: Pays an invoice.

Body: { "payment_request": "<lnbc...>" }
